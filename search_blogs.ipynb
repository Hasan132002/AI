            "Content: In every era, children usually have a similar carefree attitude. Even at the age of seven or eight years, they cannot reach the depth of any matter. But, unlike other children, the childhood of A’la Hadrat رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَيْه was very outstanding. He was so sensible and had so excellent memory even in the childhood that he succeeded in completing the recitation of the complete Holy Quran in the early age of just 4½ years. At the age of six, he delivered a detailed speech on the topic of Milad-un-Nabi صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم in front of a very large gathering in the blessed month of Rabi’-ul-Awwal and was fully appreciated by the scholars and  saints.At the same age, he رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَيْه got information about the direction of Baghdad (the sacred city of Ghaus-e-A’zam رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَيْه). He رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَيْه then never stretched his legs in that blessed direction out of respect. He رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَيْه was extremely enthusiastic about Salah and would offer the daily five Salahs in Masjid with Takbeer-e-Aula.\n",
